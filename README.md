Superstore Returns Analysis Project Overview

    This project analyzes historical order and return data from Superstore to uncover the root causes 
    of high return rates. By identifying trends across customers, product categories, and geographic 
    regions, this analysis provides actionable insights to reduce returns and improve business profitability.

Goals

    Identify Key Drivers of Returns: Understand patterns in customer behavior, product performance, and return rates.
    Analyze Geographic and Seasonal Trends: Determine if returns are concentrated in specific regions or time periods.
    Actionable Recommendations: Develop data-driven strategies to reduce returns and improve customer satisfaction.

Tools Used

    Google Sheets: Data cleaning and preliminary analysis.
    Tableau: Visualization of return trends and development of an interactive dashboard.

Key Findings

    Product Categories: Certain categories consistently show higher return rates, indicating potential 
    quality or customer expectation issues.
    Customer Behavior: Repeat customers with frequent orders account for a disproportionate share of returns.
    Geographic Insights: Some regions have significantly higher return rates than others.
    Seasonal Patterns: Returns spike during certain months, possibly tied to holidays or sales events.

Insights and Recommendations

    Address High-Risk Categories: Identify what products are most returned, when those products are 
    being returned and where products are being returned the most. From these we can begin to address 
    any products, regions and seasons that need to be focused on.
    Target High-Return Customers: Identify what customers have the highest return rates. We can touch 
    bases with these customers and identify why products were returned and how we can 
    improve on product retention.
    Regional Strategy: Identify what regions or states are experiencing higher than average returns and 
    begin to assess if there may be a distribution concern or sales concern.
    Sales vs Returns Metrics: We can see how returns affect sales, and if there is any correlation between 
    levels of sales and levels of returns. From this we can address potential sales training or staffing 
    concerns to ensure our customers receive the correct product.
